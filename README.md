# MIAMI-summer-research: Deeping Retinal Image Analysis
The website of our dataset: https://github.com/nkicsl/OIA.
GAA means gender & age.
Non-gaa means with gender & age.
In the code file, the naming of the referenced .py file or .npy file is sometimes wrong, but it is harmless.
We uploaded all the code for training and testing and the .npy file for the second training session.
