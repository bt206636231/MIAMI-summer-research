This paper proposed the importance of age and gender information in the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. We use Deep Residual Neural Network (resnet) and Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (densenet), which is proved effective on the problems of image classification, into the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy using the retinal fundus image. We fused several classical network and decentralizes the training so that the network wonâ€™t be so complex and overfitting. To watch whether the age and gender information can help enhance the performance, we add those information before the dense layer and compare the result with
the result that did not add the age and gender information. We found that the network with age and gender information performs better than that without those information. So we strongly recommend that researchers bring age, gender and other relevant information when making relevant datasets.
